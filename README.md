# PSK - Python Starter Kit-00

###### Why 00? Because we start counting from zero.

(This is a template repo for everyone doing PSK-00. Feel free to edit it!)

# Welcome
> Simple is better than complex.

A lot of Python developers know this line. It's from the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). More on that later.
Python as a language is among the best to start coding with. Why? I think it's the simple to get up to speed with and is versatile (it can be used in many fields)

## Setup
You have two options:

#### Web:

- Get to this [assignment on Repl.it](https://repl.it/teacher/assignments/4141957) to continue.


#### Local: (On a local computer)

- Install Python. Refer to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/NdagiStanley/bf9db623e8a96ef2ab631a28c9a1eba8) depending on your OS.
- <details>
  <summary>Install and run VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can use an editor of choice.</summary>

  VSCode is a popular editor.
  
  More on Python in VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
  
  Install [Python extension on VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) (optional)

  </details>

- Clone this repo or copy the contents of main.py into a local main.py. Being able to clone repos and commit changes from the terminal will be an expected knowledge over time ðŸ’ª

## LEARNING
Read through this [wiki](https://github.com/Bridge-The-Gap-Series/PSK-00/wiki/Hello-World) for foundational knowledge.

## EXERCISE
Submit code that outputs the following:
```
Hello World

My name is Stan.
I am 20+ years of age. Young, right? ðŸ˜ƒ

The maximum number in this list: [12, 4, 56, 17, 8, 99] is 99.
The mean: [12, 4, 56, 17, 8, 99] is 32.666666666666664

A for Apple
B for Boy
C for Cow
...
Z for Zebra
```

With extensive research and reading, try to output this with elegant code. Elegant code here means code that is using descriptive variable names an the language's types and functions. Go beyond just using strings.

See you next week!

## Submit assignment

- You'll be required to update `main.py` with your code from the code editor on repl.it or your local code editor.
